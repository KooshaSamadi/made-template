# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Analyzing the Correlation Between Temperature Changes and greenhouse gas emissions from different sources in Germany Project

## Main Questions

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
 1. How Have Temperature Changes and Emissions Varied Over the Years in Germany?

 2. How Are Temperature Changes Correlated with Emissions?


## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
It's important to understand how climate change and gas emission from different sources are related. My data science project looks at how temperature changes and gas emissions specifically CO2 interact in Germany. The goal is to learn things that can help government leaders make plans to reduce the negative impacts of climate change on the environment.
I will be examining how temperature changes and emissions have evolved over the years, focusing specifically on Germany. One of my primary areas of interest is the correlation between temperature fluctuations and different types of emissions within this region. This focus is driven by the need to understand how well these efforts are correlating with changes in temperature patterns and to provide actionable insights that can guide environmental policies in Germany.


## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
I have selected the FAO Corporate Statistical Database as my primary data source for its extensive range of reliable and comprehensive statistical data. This source is particularly valuable due to its well-maintained records and robust reputation in the field.
* Metadata URL: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GT
* Data URL: https://bulks-faostat.fao.org/production/Emissions_Totals_E_Europe.zip
* Data Type: CSV
* License: CC0: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO <br>
The FAOSTAT Emissions Totals domain offers detailed data on greenhouse gas emissions from agrifood systems, tracking emissions such as methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and fluorinated gases (F-gases). This data adheres to the IPCC Tier 1 methodology and covers various economic sectors as outlined by the IPCC.


### Datasource2: Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
For temperature data, I have again chosen FAO due to their comprehensive environmental statistics.
* Metadata URL: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET
* Data URL: https://bulks-faostat.fao.org/production/Environment_Temperature_change_E_Europe.zip
* Data Type: CSV
* License: CC0: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO <br>
The FAOSTAT Temperature Change on Land domain provides statistics on mean surface temperature changes by country, updated annually. This dataset covers the period from 1961 to 2023 and includes monthly, seasonal, and annual mean temperature anomalies.
