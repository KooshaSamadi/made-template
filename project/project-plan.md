# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Awesome MADE project.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
- How can analyzing the frequency and distribution of forest fires in Brazil help local communities and policymakers?
- How can analyzing historical weather patterns in Australia help agricultural stakeholders make informed decisions?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Forest fires are a critical environmental issue because they lead to significant loss of biodiversity, contribute to carbon emissions, and disrupt ecological balance.This project analyzes the incidence of forest fires in Brazil, utilizing time series data to track frequency and distribution across different states over a period from 1998 to 2017. Weather variability is an important concern because it affects ecosystems, human health, and various economic sectors. This project analyzes Australian weather patterns, using historical data from various meteorological stations across the country.
