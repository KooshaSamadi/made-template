## Analyzing the Correlation Between Temperature Changes and greenhouse gas emissions from different sources in Germany


It's important to understand how climate change and gas emission from different sources are related. My data science project looks at how temperature changes and gas emissions specifically CO2 interact in Germany. The goal is to learn things that can help government leaders make plans to reduce the negative impacts of climate change on the environment.
I will be examining how temperature changes and emissions have evolved over the years, focusing specifically on Germany. One of my primary areas of interest is the correlation between temperature fluctuations and different types of emissions within this region. This focus is driven by the need to understand how well these efforts are correlating with changes in temperature patterns and to provide actionable insights that can guide environmental policies in Germany.
